Why did I took Open Source Software Development?

When I look at my Degree Works web page at Cuny First, I find out there are plenty of major courses that I haven't taken yet. I start to search for the courses that I have to take in order to graduate, and there is Open Source Software Development. I assume this is a course where the professor teaches us how to get used to some open-source software, such as GitHub or GitLab. However, when I get deeper into the course I noticed that this process is not as simple as utilizing the open-source software to devise a project, but it also a lesson of communication, collaboration, and invention. After the course, I think I should be able to create something new with others, something that has been revised, improved numerous times.
