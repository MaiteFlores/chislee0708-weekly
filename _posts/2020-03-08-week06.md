___Semester Project___

My team chose [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) as the final selection of the semester project to contributes to it. Next.js was a framework for rendering [React](https://reactjs.org/) applications on the server. We also decided "Teammates of Next.js" (TON) as our team name, TON has 4 members, Liulan, Michelle, Shania, and myself. In the beginning, we picked [TEAMMATES](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates) as the semester project, but we all having problems while installing. So instead of choosing TEAMMATES, we decided to change the project to Next.js. Certainly, we did some research on Next.js, and there are plenty of good first issues for newcomers to contribute. In addition, the source code itself is easy to understand, and there are at least 78.2k lines of code in Next.js, which makes Next.js a large project. My next step is to fork, clone, and install Next.js in my own local machine. Relatively, The installation process of Next.js was slightly simpler than the installation process TEAMMATES. It only takes like 10 minutes for the installation to be completed. The installation of this project includes installing [yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn) and [chromedriver](https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html) to the local machine. The next step is to execute the test command
```sh
yarn testonly
```
to see if all the files installed properly, which is a monotonous process. This time it took me around 3 hours of waiting for all tests to be terminated. The output was as follow:
```sh
Test Suites: 5 failed, 152 passed, 157 total
Tests:       64 failed, 4 skipped, 1772 passed, 1840 total
Snapshots:   156 passed, 156 total
Time:        10578.845s
Ran all test suites.
```
The next issue to be considered was the difficulty of the issues in the issues tracker in which we were going to contributes, which will be continued in next week's blog.
