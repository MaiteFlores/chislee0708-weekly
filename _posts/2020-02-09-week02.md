Various ways on contributions and FOSS benefits.


There are plenty of ways I can contribute to one or more free open source software projects during this semester. First, the most significant thing before contributing to any project is to carefully read through the CONTRIBUTE.md file of the project. The CONTRIBUTE.md provides me a list of instructions or rules of what I need to follow in order to bring improvements to the project, such as fixing bugs under the issue tracker, translating the original file to another programming language, and writing documentation for update logs. Next, after Iâ€™ve made my contribution, I can send a merge request to the core-contributors. If the core-contributor approves my contributions, then I have successfully contributed to an open source project.

By contributing to a FOSS project and following the regulation to CONTRIBUTE.md file, I am not only acquiring satisfaction, but also developing expertise. For example, FOSS can benefit my personal skills and networking skills through communicating and collaborating with all kinds of people around the world. It also allows me to treat others in a polite or well-bred social behavior. Furthermore, if I use FOSS as a preparation for my career, I would able to contribute to projects without having any difficulty that are currently existing in the company. However, the premise is that I must understand all the materials from this course in this semester.
